Very simple to get everything up and running (Moreso than last time :P)
I created a makefile so all you have to do is make sure all c files are unzipped in the same folder with the makefile.
type "make" into the terminal while you are in the unzipped folder. everything should compile.

Once everything is compiled, just type ./shhh and the shhh terminal should open up. Everything has been compiled and run on the school boxes so there should be absolutely 0 issues. All functionality works. Make sure you are typing the correct commands because the teacher said "make the assumption that only valid commands will be typed"

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
